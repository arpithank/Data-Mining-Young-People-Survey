# Data-Mining-Young-People-Survey

The project explains the nature of the dataset(Young people survey) and what I hope to uncover from my analysis. The Plot or visualization of the data is given and the essential characteristics are described. I have also explained the statistical model and/orclassification approach I am using and why I have chosen it. I have also provided validation of the model. I have documented the model, and its performance on independent test data.  All experiments are performed in R. I have included plots as needed and submited the code for all experiments I have performed.
